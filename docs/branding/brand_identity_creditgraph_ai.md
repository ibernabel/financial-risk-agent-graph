# **Brand Identity: CreditGraph AI**

This document defines the conceptual and strategic foundation for the new name of the credit evaluation system based on intelligent agents.

## **1. Name Description**

**CreditGraph AI** is a credit intelligence orchestration platform that uses specialized agent graphs to transform unstructured data into precise financial decisions.

Unlike traditional linear systems, the name communicates an interconnected analysis network where financial information, digital behavior (OSINT), and credit history converge into a single point of truth: the **Internal Risk Score (IRS)**.

## **2. Element Breakdown**

### **Credit (The Domain)**

It immediately establishes the field of operation. It represents the accumulated experience in the Dominican financial sector, portfolio management, and the creditworthiness analysis capacity that defines the core of the business.

### **Graph (The Methodology)**

Represents the technical architecture and the depth of the analysis:

- **Technical:** Direct reference to the use of **LangGraph**, where decision logic is structured into nodes and edges with persistent states.
- **Conceptual:** Symbolizes the system's ability to "connect the dots" between isolated sources (social networks, bank statements from banks like Popular or BHD, and credit bureau reports) to detect hidden risk or fraud patterns.

### **AI (The Engine)**

Highlights that the reasoning is neither static nor based on rigid rules, but driven by state-of-the-art language models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o). It indicates the agents' capacity to perform "forensic analysis" with a level of judgment similar to that of a senior analyst.

## **3. Decision Justification**

The transition from _CreditFlow_ to **CreditGraph AI** is based on three strategic pillars:

### **A. Competitive Differentiation**

The market is saturated with names using the "-flow" suffix. By adopting **Graph**, the product distances itself from collection management solutions or simple workflows, positioning itself as a **data science and deep intelligence** tool.

### **B. Architectural Coherence (Explainability)**

One of the strengths of the PRD is "narrative justification" and decision traceability. A graph allows for visualizing exactly which node (agent) influenced the final result. The name reinforces this transparency, which is vital for winning the trust of financial institutions.

### **C. Focus on the Informal Economy**

To evaluate an informal worker in the DR, an "A leads to B" flow is not enough. A **trust graph** is needed to validate their digital presence (Instagram/Facebook) and actual bank movements. **CreditGraph AI** projects this capability to understand complex information networks.

## **4. Suggested Tagline**

_"Connecting the dots of invisible risk."_
